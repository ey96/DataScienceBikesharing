## Python software packages
This directory shows an example of a python package (called pds). 
Once you are in the same directory, you can install it to your machine via
`pip install -e .`. This way, it's installed in _editable_ mode and your
changes in the python files will directly be available without reinstallation.
This does not apply for changes in `setup.py`.

The command line interface is created with click (https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/). 
There are other packages available for this and we don't force you to work with
a specific one. Also, you don't have to use Pycharm (as I did). If you don't
have a preference, feel free to do exactly the same as in the video for your
python packages!
